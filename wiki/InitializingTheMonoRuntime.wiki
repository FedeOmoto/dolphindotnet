#summary Configuring and initializing the Mono runtime.

= Initializing the Mono runtime =

Once you've installed Mono and the DolphinDotNET package, the next step before starting using .NET from Dolphin Smalltalk is configuring/initializing the Mono runtime.

Assuming you've installed Mono in the "C:\Mono-2.8" directory, you can evaluate this in a Workspace to do the runtime initialization:

{{{
| monoRuntime |

monoRuntime := MonoRuntime current.
monoRuntime assemblyPath: 'C:\Mono-2.8\lib'.
monoRuntime configurationPath: 'C:\Mono-2.8\etc'.
monoRuntime initialize.
}}}

And that's it! Now you can start using .NET classes from Dolphin.
