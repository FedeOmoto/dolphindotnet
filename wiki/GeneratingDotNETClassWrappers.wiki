#summary Generating .NET class wrappers.

= Generating .NET class wrappers =

So, you've installed Mono, the DolphinDotNET package, configured/initialized the Mono runtime and now you're wondering "How do I use all that .NET classes?". If you want to use some .NET classes all you've to do is generating wrappers for them.

Let suppose that you want to use the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.aspx DateTime] class from the mscorlib assembly, in order to generate the wrapper you can evaluate:

{{{
assembly := MonoAssembly named: 'mscorlib'.
dateTimeMonoClass := assembly class: 'DateTime' namespace: 'System'.
(MonoClassBuilder on: dateTimeMonoClass) build.
}}}

The MonoClassBuilder class works on MonoClass objects and generate wrappers for them on #build.
Now you can take a look at the generated wrapper, it's a subclass of MonoObject named System_DateTime.
