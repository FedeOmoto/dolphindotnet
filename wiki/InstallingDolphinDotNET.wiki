#summary Installing DolphinDotNET.

= Installing DolphinDotNET =

You can obtain the DolphinDotNET package from the project's [http://code.google.com/p/dolphindotnet/downloads/list Download section]. From time to time I'll update the download file.

If you want a more up to date version of DolphinDotNET (that is, the version I'm currently working on), you can grab it from the project's [http://code.google.com/p/dolphindotnet/source/browse/trunk repository trunk].
