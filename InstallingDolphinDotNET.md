# Installing DolphinDotNET #

You can obtain the DolphinDotNET package from the project's [Downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/dolphindotnet/downloads/list). I'll try to update the download file from time to time.

If you want a more up to date version of DolphinDotNET (that is, the version I'm currently working on), you can grab it from the project's [repository trunk](http://code.google.com/p/dolphindotnet/source/browse/trunk).
